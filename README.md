# Holiday Reservation Application
In the context of IS2103 (Enterprise Systems Server-side Design and Development) during the AY23/24 academic year, a straightforward Jakarta EE (EJB) application for booking holidays.

The system aimed to incorporate the functionalities of a standard holiday reservation system into a multi-tier project. The presentation tier utilizes a CLI interface, while the logic tier is implemented using EJB technology, and the data tier is sourced from a GlassFish database. The system also presented the challenge of completely encapsulating and abstracting functional and scalable code. It led to a deeper understanding of the significance of multi-tier architecture, emphasizing component-based development.
